@section{Introduction}
Documents in the @tt{mathbook} language can contain mathematical formulas.
There are two types of formulas inline and display formulas.
The scribble constructs to make formulars are called @tt{$} and @tt{$$}. 
An inline formula @${a^2+b^2=c^2} appears as part of the text and a display 
formula @$${a^2+b^2=c^2} appears centered on a line of its own.

A mathbook rendered as HTML use MathJax to render the formulas.
